Excerpt from abstract:

1. We have developed a compartmental model of a turtle cerebellar granule 
cell consisting of 13 compartments that represent the soma and 4 
dendrites. We used this model to investigate the synaptic integration of 
mossy fiber inputs in granule cells. 
2. The somatic compartment contained six active ionic conductances: 
a sodium conductance with fast activation and inactivation kinetics, 
gNa; a high-voltage-activated calcium conductance, gCa(HVA); a 
delayed potassium conductance, gK(DR); a transient potassium 
conductance, gK(A); a slowly relaxing mixed Na+/K+ conductance 
activating at hyperpolarized membrane potentials, gH, and a 
calcium- and voltage-dependent potassium conductance, gK(Ca). The 
kinetics of these conductances was derived from electrophysiological 
studies in a variety of preparations, including turtle and rat granule 
cells. 
3. In the soma, dynamics of intracellular free Ca2+ was modeled 
by incorporation of a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, radial diffusion, and binding 
sites for Ca2+. 
4. The model of the turtle granule cell exhibited depolarization-induced
action potential firing with properties closely resembling those seen 
with intracellular recordings in turtle granule cells in vitro.
